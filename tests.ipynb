      "- Edit the config file `src/site.config.ts` for basic site meta data\n",
      "  - Read [this post](http://astro-cactus.chriswilliams.dev/posts/webmentions/) for adding webmentions to your site, otherwise set `siteConfig.webmentions.link` to an empty value.\n",
      "- Update file `astro.config.ts` site property with your own domain.\n",
      "- Replace & update files within the `/public` folder:\n",
      "  - favicon.ico & other social icons\n",
      "  - robots.txt - update the Sitemap url to your own domain\n",
      "  - manifest.webmanifest\n",
      "- Modify file `src/styles/global.css` with your own light and dark styles.\n",
      "  - You can also modify the theme(s) for markdown code blocks generated by [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com). Astro Cactus has both a dark (dracula) and light (github-light) theme, which can be found in `src/site.config.ts`. You can find more theme(s) and options [here](https://expressive-code.com/guides/themes/#available-themes).\n",
      "- Edit social links in `src/components/SocialList.astro` to add/replace your media profile. Icons can be found @ [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org/), per [Astro Icon's instructions](https://www.astroicon.dev/guides/customization/#find-an-icon-set).\n",
      "- Create / edit posts for your blog within `src/content/post/` with .md/mdx file(s). See [below](#adding-posts) for more details.\n",
      "- OG Image:\n",
      "  - If you would like to change the style of the generated image the Satori library creates, open up `src/pages/og-image/[slug].png.ts` to the markup function where you can edit the html/tailwind-classes as necessary. You can also use this [satori playground](https://og-playground.vercel.app/) to aid your design.\n",
      "  - If you would like to generate svg og images rather than the default .png ones, you will need to remove the @resvg/resvg-js library, and return the svg within the body of the get function from the file `src/pages/og-image/[slug].png.ts`.\n",
      "  - You can also create your own og images and skip satori generating it for you by adding an ogImage property in the frontmatter with a link to the asset, an example can be found in `src/content/post/social-image.md`. More info on frontmatter can be found [here](#frontmatter)\n",
      "- Optional:\n",
      "  - Fonts: This theme sets the body element to the font family `font-mono`, located in the global css file `src/styles/global.css`. You can change fonts by removing the variant `font-mono`, after which TailwindCSS will default to the `font-sans` [font family stack](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family).\n",

      "## Adding posts\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Adding a post is as simple as adding your .md(x) files to the `src/content/post` folder, the filename of which will be used as the slug/url. The posts included with this template are there as an example of how to structure your frontmatter. Additionally, the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) has a detailed section on markdown pages.\n",

Has a max length of 60 chars, set in `src/content/config.ts`                                                                                                                                   |\n",

      "| publishDate \\*         | Again pretty simple. To change the date format/locale, currently **en-GB**, update the date option in `src/site.config.ts`. Note you can also pass additional options to the component `<FormattedDate>` if required.                                                                                        |\n",
      "| updatedDate            | This is an optional date representing when a post has been updated, in the same format as the publishDate. Note that by providing this field, the sorting function, found in `src/utils/post.ts`, `sortMDByDate` will order by this field rather than its published date.                                    |\n",
      "| tags                   | Tags are optional with any created post. Any new tag(s) will be shown in `yourdomain.com/posts` & `yourdomain.com/tags`, and generate the page(s) `yourdomain.com/tags/[yourTag]`                                                                                                                            |\n",
      "| coverImage             | This is an optional object that will add a cover image to the top of a post. Include both a `src`: \"_path-to-image_\" and `alt`: \"_image alt_\". You can view an example in `src/content/post/cover-image.md`.                                                                                                 |\n",

If you would like to create your own for a specific post, include this property and a link to your image, the theme will then skip automatically generating one.            |\n",
      "| draft                  | This is an optional property as it is set to false by default in the schema. By adding true, the post will be filtered out of the production build in a number of places, inc. getAllPosts() calls, og-images, rss feeds, and generated page[s]. You can view an example in `src/content/post/draft-post.md` |\n",

      "### Frontmatter snippet\n",
      "\n",
      "Astro Cactus includes a helpful VSCode snippet which creates a frontmatter 'stub' for a blog post, found here -> `.vscode/post.code-snippets`. Start typing the word `frontmatter` on your newly created .md(x) file to trigger it. Visual Studio Code snippets appear in IntelliSense via (⌃Space) on mac, (Ctrl+Space) on windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pagefind search\n",
      "\n",
      "This integration brings a static search feature for searching blog posts. In its current form, pagefind only works once the site has been built. This theme adds a postbuild script that should be run after Astro has built the site. You can preview locally by running both build && postbuild.\n",
      "\n",
      "Search results only includes blog posts. If you would like to include other/all your pages, remove/re-locate the attribute `data-pagefind-body` to the article tag found in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also allows you to filter posts by tags added in the frontmatter of blog posts. If you would rather remove this, remove the data attribute `data-pagefind-filter=\"tag\"` from the link in `src/components/blog/Hero.astro`.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you would rather not include this integration, simply remove the component `src/components/Search.astro`, and uninstall both `@pagefind/default-ui` & `pagefind` from package.json. You will also need to remove the postbuild script from here as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can reduce the initial css payload of your css, as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus/pull/145#issue-1943779868), by lazy loading the web components styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Analytics\n",
      "\n",
      "You may want to track the number of visitors you receive to your blog/website in order to understand trends and popular posts/pages you've created. There are a number of providers out there one could use, including web hosts such as [vercel](https://vercel.com/analytics), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/), and [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).\n",
      "\n",
      "This theme/template doesn't include a specific solution due to there being a number of use cases and/or options which some people may or may not use.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may be asked to included a snippet inside the **HEAD** tag of your website when setting it up, which can be found in `src/layouts/Base.astro`. Alternatively, you could add the snippet in `src/components/BaseHead.astro`.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Deploy\n",
      "\n",
      "[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) has a great section and breakdown of how to deploy your own Astro site on various platforms and their idiosyncrasies.\n",
